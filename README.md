## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I'm not sure if it's my version of xcode, but I had a few problems.
The first was that my TableViewController would not display anything, no mater what settings I used.
The second is that I can't initialize an array in a class without getting an error message that the class
has no initializers. I had to rewrite my roulette code from a dynamic one to a static one because of this.'
